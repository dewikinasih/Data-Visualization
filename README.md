# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This repository is for the visualization projects i've done for self-learning and hobby purposes. Mainly presented in tableau projects

# Superstore Dashboard
I start my visualization projects with sample dataset provided by tableau
- The dataset contains information about products,sales, and profits within fictitious company
- The dashboard explain the total sales, profit, and quantity sold based on product category and sub-category, region, state, and customer segment

# Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories
Since i love to watch hollywood's movie, i want to know what kind of stories with the highest profitability. Luckily, i found the dataset in tableau sample dataset (again) and i create the dashboard without any further do
- The dataset contains title, genre, studio, profitability, and ratings for movies released 2007-2012
  - There are still missing values in some variables. Thus, i tried to solve this problem using Rstudio ()
- With this dashboard, i got the insightful information about The highest rating from viewers or the highest profitability of the genre,studio, and title in the certain period of time

# Millennials Vs Baby Boomers Employment

# Monkeypox Cases Report
I got the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/monkeypox-dataset-daily-updated). The information within the dataset is about daily updated cases of monkeypox across the world (Until 26 August 2022)
- The dataset has more than 50.000 rows and 36 column, but found that this dataset still have some missing values and unuseful variable (especially for visualization purposes). Therefore, i solve those problem with Rstudio ()
- The important information of the dataset includes in the dashboard such as the growth of confirmed case, the infected country, etc
